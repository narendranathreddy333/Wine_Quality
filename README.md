# Wine Quality Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and predicting wine quality using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is likely sourced from a well-known wine quality dataset . It contains various physicochemical attributes of wine samples, such as acidity, alcohol content, and pH, with quality ratings as labels.

## Features
- **Data Loading:** Reads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalizes features, and prepares data for training.
- **Model Training:** Implements machine learning models to predict wine quality.
